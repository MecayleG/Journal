# Journal
A journal or track record of my journey to learning something new (something I've never used or done before) on a regular. 

* This is purely for the fun of learning and for the enjoyment of coding in the front-end.
---
* I will be using bootstrap as the foundation for my journal. All the content will come from myself and the places I learnt them from.

1. I have always wondered what you would use input type="color" for..... This was a fun little task, it refreshed my memory when it comes to the DOM and how simple javascript can be.

2. John Smilga taught me how to make a simple counter that can increase, decrease and reset. I never used querySelectorAll, currentTarget and contains before which he explains really nicely in his video. Also instead of style.color I usually do classlist.add but it was nice knowing these elements exist and how they can be used.

3. I always wanted to try canvas! This was fun but also quite tricky and involved alot of properties, methods and numbers(which I had never used). Luckily W3Schools explains the code in this awesome tutorial.

4. I discovered this tag a few months ago and it seemed so simple to use, it also requires no javascript to set up, unless of course you want to spice it up and play things based on conditions.

5. Modals are so fun to use, they are like cool pop up cards and only with a few lines of Javascript. References for this project - https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp (project origin), https://www.fabriziovanmarciano.com/button-styles/ (button style).
6. W3Schools at it again showing me how to make a simple slideshow. One thing I noticed about these projects is they love applying display styles using Javascript for the desired effect.
