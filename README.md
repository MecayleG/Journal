# Journal
A journal or track record of my journey to learning something new (something I've never used or done before) on a regular. 

This is purely for the fun of learning and for the enjoyment of coding in the front-end.

I will be using bootstrap as the framework and foundation for my journal. I used it once before to redo a project 
that I styled myself but actually found bootstrap to be much easier and faster. All the content will come from myself and the places i learn them from
