# Journal
A journal or track record of my journey to learning something new (something I've never used or done before) on a regular. 

* This is purely for the fun of learning and for the enjoyment of coding in the front-end.
---
* I will be using bootstrap as the foundation for my journal. All the content will come from myself and the places I learnt them from.

* Check the about section of my website to see the references, you can find my commentary on the about section too as well as the names of the projects.
