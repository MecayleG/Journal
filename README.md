# Journal
A journal or track record of my journey to learning something new (something I've never used or done before) on a regular. 

* This is purely for the fun of learning and for the enjoyment of coding in the front-end.
---
* I will be using bootstrap as the foundation for my journal. All the content will come from myself and the places I learnt them from.

1. I have always wondered what you would use input type="color" for..... This was a fun little task, it refreshed my memory when it comes to the DOM and how simple javascript can be.

2. John Smilga taught me how to make a simple counter that can increase, decrease and reset. I never used querySelectorAll, currentTarget and contains before which he explains really nicely in his video. Also instead of style.color I usually do classlist.add but it was nice knowing these elements exist and how they can be used.
